# Problem 2
url: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
difficulty: medium

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

## Summary
Alright, so we are storing a number all weird as if each diget is a different entry into a linked list
Read the linked list, convert to a number, add, and convert back to a list.

## Notes
I checked out the "best" solutions and it's what I did within a single loop instead of using recurssion.
