# 66 plus one
Difficulty: easy

An integer is represented as an array, add one to it and return the new array.

## Notes
I did this after problem 2 and this is the easier form of problem 2.
Problem 2 does this with a linked list instead of an array and it adds
an arbitrary number instead of always adding 1.

So, found it easy and it's an easy problem.
